# HAR-on-UCF-Crime-dataset
# Abstract
Surveillance videos can capture a variety of realistic anomalies/unlawfully
activities but there is no real-time analysis of those captured feed. In this project
we propose, two different methods to detect anomaly activities in real-time, 1.
Multiple classes by detecting single activity in real-time and 2. Normal activities
and Unlawful activities.
Our proposed algorithm for video time-scale squeezing was able to standardize the
UCF-Crime data-set by rewriting each video with a fixed time length of 1 second in
total creating a new standardized data-set.The proposed methods were trained on a
3D residual neural network (ResNet 3D 18) with our unique data prepossessing
method along with our algorithm for data-set augmentation which achieves
significant improvement in anomaly detection performance as compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches. Our prediction method itself is 25-30 times faster than
any other method/script/algorithm available on the Internet.It is capable of
analysing long untrim videos and segmenting the unlawfully/anomaly activities in
an efficient way
